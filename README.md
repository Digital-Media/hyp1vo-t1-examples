# HYP1VO Hypermedia 1 Part 1 Web Programming Examples

These are the code examples that accompany the lecture notes for HYP1VO Hypermedia 1 Part 1 Web Programming.  Topics revolve around basic web development techniques such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

* Lecturer: [Wolfgang Hochleitner](https://github.com/hochleitner)

Files in the ``main`` branch will change continuously throughout the summer semester. Once all lectures are completed, a tag will be created for the respective semester, and this state will be available for download as a [release](https://github.com/Digital-Media/hyp1vo-t1-examples/releases).

## Usage

1. Optional: Get a development webserver (e.g. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)) or a [Vagrant box](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
2. Get a proper IDE (e.g. [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)).
3. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file into your server's document root or the Vagrant shared folder.
4. Open the files in your web browser. The examples for each lecture are in the respective folder (e.g. `vl01` for lecture 1).

* Use your IDE to examine the contents of the files and see how they work.
* Pull the repository regularly to get the latest changes.
